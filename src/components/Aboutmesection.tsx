            I’m Abishkar Dhenga, a passionate self-taught programmer with a deep
            love for JavaScript. My journey has been focused on building
            scalable and efficient web applications, where I’ve gained hands-on
            experience with GraphQL and Docker. I’m always on the lookout for
            new things to learn and grow as a developer. Recently, I’ve been
            diving into React Native to develop Android and iOS applications,
            and I’m excited by how much I’ve progressed. Beyond coding, I’m an
            avid reader with a strong interest in politics, economics,
            spirituality, and startups—areas that inspire me to think broadly
            and deeply about the world. My curiosity extends beyond tech. I’m
            enthusiastic about learning new skills like sales and marketing. In
            fact, one of my proudest achievements was growing an Instagram page
            from 0 to 5,000 followers in just four months—a result of applying
            what I learned about engagement, consistency, and strategic growth.
            I’m a firm believer in the power of discipline, consistency, and
            hard work. In my downtime, I often find myself exploring new ideas
            through books and articles, seeking inspiration, and collaborating
            with like-minded, talented people from around the world. At present,
            I’m working on a personal project—an app designed to solve some of
            my own challenges. I believe the best solutions come from firsthand
            experience, and this app reflects that philosophy. I’m always open
            to new opportunities where I can apply my skills, grow further, and
            make a meaningful impact.
